        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Piazza del Popolo was originally designed as the northern entrance to
          Rome, where travelers from the Via Flaminia would first set foot in
          the city. The square’s layout was significantly transformed in the
          16th and 19th centuries, shaping it into the elegant space we see
          today. One of its most notable elements is the Flaminian Obelisk, an
          ancient Egyptian obelisk brought to Rome by Emperor Augustus in 10 BC.
          Originally erected in the Circus Maximus, it was later moved to the
          piazza by Pope Sixtus V in the late 16th century as part of his grand
          urban planning projects. The square’s name is often linked to the
          Church of Santa Maria del Popolo, a Renaissance masterpiece that
          houses works by Caravaggio and Raphael. Some theories suggest the name
          “Popolo” derives from the Latin word for “poplar trees,” which once
          grew in the area.

        <h3>Architectural Marvels</h3>
        <p>The Twin Churches</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The two Baroque churches, Santa Maria in Montesanto and Santa Maria
            dei Miracoli, stand symmetrically on either side of Via del Corso’s
            entrance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Though they appear identical, small architectural differences set
            them apart.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Flaminian Obelisk</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Standing at 36 meters (118 feet), this obelisk is one of the tallest
            in Rome.
          </li>
          <li>
            Originally from the Temple of Ra in Heliopolis, Egypt, it was
            transported to Rome by Emperor Augustus.

        </ul>
        <p>The Porta del Popolo</p>

          <li>
            The grand entrance to the square, formerly known as the Flaminian
            Gate, was redesigned by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1655 to welcome
            Queen Christina of Sweden to Rome.
          </li>
          <li>
            The inscription on the gate, commissioned by Pope Alexander VII,
            translates to: “Happy and Blessed Rome.”
