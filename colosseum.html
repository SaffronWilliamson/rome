        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheater, is one of the
          most iconic landmarks of Ancient Rome. It was commissioned by Emperor
          Vespasian of the Flavian Dynasty in 70-72 AD and completed by his son,
          Emperor Titus, in 80 AD. Later modifications were made by Emperor
          Domitian, making it a key project of the Flavian emperors. Built on
          the site of Nero’s Domus Aurea (Golden House), the Colosseum
          symbolized the return of the land to the people of Rome after Nero’s
          extravagant reign. It became the largest amphitheater ever built,
          capable of holding an estimated 50,000–80,000 spectators. The
          Colosseum was primarily used for gladiatorial contests, animal hunts,
          public spectacles, and executions. Over time, it suffered damage from
          earthquakes, fires, and stone robbers, but it remains an enduring
          symbol of Roman engineering and entertainment.

        <h3>Architectural Marvels</h3>
        <p>Size and Structure</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Colosseum measures approximately 189 meters (615 feet) long, 156
            meters (510 feet) wide, and stands about 50 meters (164 feet) high.
          </li>
          <li>
            Built primarily of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and
            concrete, it showcases advanced Roman engineering.
          </li>
          <li>
            The structure consists of four levels, with the uppermost reserved
            for the lower classes and women.
          </li>
          <li>
            The outer façade originally had three tiers of arches framed by
            Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Arena and Hypogeum</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The arena was covered in wooden planks and sand (Latin: harena, from
            which the word “arena” comes).
          </li>
          <li>
            Beneath the arena lies the hypogeum, an underground network of
            tunnels and cages where gladiators and animals were kept before
            entering the arena through trapdoors and lifts.
          </li>
          <li>
            A sophisticated system of pulleys, ramps, and elevators allowed for
            dramatic entrances of wild animals and gladiators.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Seating Arrangement (Cavea)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Roman society was strictly hierarchical, and seating in the
            Colosseum reflected this:
            <ul class="secondary-list">
              <li>
                - <em>Emperor, senators, and elite</em> sat closest to the
                arena.
              </li>
              <li>- <em>Roman citizens </em>occupied the middle tiers.</li>
              <li>
                - <em>Women, slaves, and the poor </em>were relegated to the
                uppermost seats.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Innovative Engineering</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Colosseum had a velarium, a retractable awning system used to
            provide shade for spectators.
          </li>
          <li>
            80 entrance arches allowed for quick crowd movement and could empty
            the entire amphitheater in minutes—a remarkable safety feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            The drainage system beneath the arena ensured that rainwater was
            efficiently removed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fun Facts & Legends</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Naval Battles? </em>Some historians believe that the Colosseum
            was briefly used for naumachiae (mock naval battles) by flooding the
            arena, but this remains debated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>A Gift to the People: </em>The Colosseum was free to enter for
            all Roman citizens. Emperors used it as a way to gain public favor
            by hosting lavish spectacles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Symbol of Christian Martyrdom? </em>While some believe that
            Christians were executed in the Colosseum, there is no definitive
            historical evidence to support this.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Looted for Other Buildings: </em>Over the centuries, materials
            from the Colosseum were repurposed for buildings like St. Peter’s
            Basilica and Palazzo Venezia.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>One of the New Seven Wonders of the World: </em>In 2007, the
            Colosseum was officially recognized as one of the New Seven Wonders
            of the World.
