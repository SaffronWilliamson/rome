        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Jewish presence in Rome dates back over 2,000 years, making it one
          of the oldest Jewish communities in Europe. In 1555, Pope Paul IV
          ordered the creation of the Ghetto of Rome, forcing the Jewish
          population to live within a confined area with strict restrictions on
          their rights and professions. The ghetto was surrounded by walls and
          frequently subjected to floods from the nearby Tiber River. The ghetto
          was finally abolished in 1870, when Italy was unified, granting Jews
          full citizenship. Today, it stands as a testament to the endurance and
          cultural richness of the Jewish community in Rome.
