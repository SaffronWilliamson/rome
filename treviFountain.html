        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi) is Rome’s most famous fountain,
          an iconic masterpiece of Baroque architecture and a symbol of romance
          and legend. Its origins date back to 19 BC, when Emperor Augustus’
          general, Marcus Agrippa, commissioned the Aqua Virgo aqueduct, which
          brought fresh water to the city. The current fountain was designed in
          1732 by Nicola Salvi and completed in 1762 by Giuseppe Pannini, under
          the patronage of Pope Clement XII. The fountain stands at the end of
          the Aqua Virgo aqueduct, which still supplies it with fresh water
          today. The name “Trevi” comes from “Tre Vie” (Three Roads), referring
          to the three streets that converge at the fountain’s location.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The Trevi Fountain stands at 26.3 meters (86 feet) high and 49.15
            meters (161 feet) wide, making it the largest Baroque fountain in
            Rome.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is set against the Palazzo Poli, which enhances its dramatic,
            theatrical effect.

          <li>
            <em>Oceanus, the God of Water – </em>The central figure, riding a
            shell-shaped chariot pulled by two seahorses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Two Tritons – </em>One leads a calm seahorse, the other a wild
            seahorse, symbolizing the changing moods of the sea.
          </li>
          <li>

            Abundance (left), spilling water from a jar, and Salubrity (right),

          </li>

        <h3>Fun Facts & Legends</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Throwing a Coin: </em>According to tradition, tossing a coin
            over your left shoulder into the fountain ensures a return to Rome.
            Throwing two coins means you’ll find love, and three means marriage!
            Each year, around €1.5 million in coins are collected and donated to
            charity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Movie Fame: </em>The fountain gained worldwide fame thanks to
            its appearance in Federico Fellini’s “La Dolce Vita” (1960), in
            which Anita Ekberg wades through its waters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Papal Influence: </em>Pope Urban VIII originally wanted the
            fountain to be much grander, but his vision was never realised due
            to funding issues.
          </li>
