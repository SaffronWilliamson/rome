        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Trevi Fountain was designed by Nicola Salvi in 1732 and completed
          by Giuseppe Pannini in 1762. It was commissioned by Pope Clement XII
          as part of a renovation project to improve the city’s water supply.
          The fountain marks the endpoint of the Aqua Virgo, an ancient Roman
          aqueduct constructed in 19 BC, which still supplies water to the
          fountain today. The name “Trevi” is believed to come from the Latin
          “Trivium,” referring to the three roads that converge at the site.
        </p>
        <h3>Architectural Highlights</h3>
        <p>The Central Figure: Oceanus</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the center of the fountain stands Oceanus, the god of all water,
            riding a shell-shaped chariot pulled by two sea horses.
          </li>
          <li>
            One horse is calm, while the other is wild, symbolizing the
            different moods of the sea.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Side Statues</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To the left of Oceanus is a statue representing Abundance, holding a
            horn of plenty.
          </li>
          <li>
            To the right is Salubrity, symbolising health and purity, with a
            snake drinking from a cup.
          </li>
          <li>
            Above these figures, bas-reliefs depict Agrippa and a young girl
            (the “Virgin”) who, according to legend, guided Roman engineers to
            the source of the Aqua Virgo.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Grand Cascade</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Water flows over artificial rock formations into a large basin
            below, creating a mesmerising waterfall effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sound of rushing water enhances the magical atmosphere, making
            it one of the most enchanting sights in Rome.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Legends & Traditions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Throwing a Coin: </em>According to tradition, tossing a coin
            over your left shoulder into the fountain ensures a return to Rome.
            Throwing two coins means you’ll find love, and three means marriage!
            Each year, around €1.5 million in coins are collected and donated to
            charity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Movie Fame: </em>The fountain gained worldwide fame thanks to
            its appearance in Federico Fellini’s “La Dolce Vita” (1960), in
            which Anita Ekberg wades through its waters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Papal Influence: </em>Pope Urban VIII originally wanted the
            fountain to be much grander, but his vision was never realised due
            to funding issues.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Visiting Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Best Time to Visit: </em>Early morning or late at night to avoid
            large crowds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Photo Tips: </em>The best pictures can be taken from the steps
            in front of the fountain, but patience is required due to crowds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>No Wading Allowed: </em>Unlike in the movies, stepping into the
            fountain is strictly prohibited and can result in hefty fines!
