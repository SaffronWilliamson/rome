        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The gallery was established in the early 17th century by Cardinal
          Scipione Borghese, a passionate art collector and patron of the
          Baroque movement. As the nephew of Pope Paul V, he had both the wealth
          and influence to acquire some of the greatest works of his time. The
          collection was originally displayed in his luxurious villa, designed
          as a showcase for his artistic treasures. Over time, the gallery
          expanded, and despite some works being taken by Napoleon in the early
          19th century (many of which now reside in the Louvre), Galleria
          Borghese remains one of the richest and most impressive art museums in
          the world.
