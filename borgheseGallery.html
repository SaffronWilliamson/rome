        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Borghese Gallery is one of Rome’s most prestigious art museums,
          renowned for its extraordinary collection of Baroque and Renaissance
          masterpieces. It was built in the early 17th century by Cardinal
          Scipione Borghese, the powerful nephew of Pope Paul V and a dedicated
          art patron. Originally designed as a private villa and museum, the
          gallery housed Scipione Borghese’s extensive art collection, featuring
          works by Caravaggio, Bernini, Raphael, and Titian. Over time, it
          became a symbol of aristocratic taste and artistic grandeur. In 1902,
          the Italian government acquired the villa, opening it as a public
          museum, making it an essential destination for art lovers and
          historians.
