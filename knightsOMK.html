        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Knights of Malta Keyhole is one of Rome’s most intriguing hidden
          gems, offering a perfectly framed view of St. Peter’s Basilica through
          a small keyhole in a door on the Aventine Hill. The keyhole belongs to
          the Priory of the Knights of Malta, a sovereign order with medieval
          origins dating back to the 11th century. The Grand Priory of Rome has
          been the headquarters of the Knights of Malta, a Catholic military and
          charitable order, for centuries. Though the priory itself is not open
          to the public, visitors gather to peek through the keyhole, where an
          astonishing optical illusion reveals a perfectly aligned pathway of
          hedges leading to St. Peter’s Dome.
        </p>
        <h3>Architectural & Symbolic Significance</h3>
        <p>The Keyhole View</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The keyhole’s alignment with St. Peter’s Basilica is no
            coincidence—it is believed to have been deliberately designed to
            create this stunning perspective.
          </li>
          <li>
            The view frames three nations at once: Italy (the Aventine Hill),
            Vatican City (St. Peter’s Basilica), and Sovereign Order of Malta
            (the priory itself, which holds extraterritorial status).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Knights of Malta Priory</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The priory, though private, is known for its stunning gardens and
            rich history.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Knights of Malta are one of the oldest chivalric orders, once
            serving as protectors of Christian pilgrims.
          </li>
          <li>
            Their sovereign status means the priory is not officially part of
            Italy—it is a tiny independent entity similar to Vatican City.
          </li>
