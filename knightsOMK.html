        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Knights of Malta Keyhole is part of the Aventine Hill, an area
          rich in history and home to various ancient and medieval sites. The
          Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a Catholic lay religious order, has
          occupied the Palazzo dei Cavalieri di Malta (Palace of the Knights of
          Malta) for centuries. The keyhole itself was intentionally aligned to
          frame the view of St. Peter’s Basilica when looking through it. This
          alignment is a stunning example of the importance of perspective and
          hidden details within Rome’s architecture. The exact origin of the
          keyhole’s alignment is unclear, but it is believed to have been
          created during the 18th century, as part of renovations to the palace.
        </p>
        <h3>The Keyhole View</h3>
        <p>
          Looking through the Knights of Malta Keyhole, you see a striking and
          perfectly symmetrical view of St. Peter’s Basilica in the distance.
          The perspective is fascinating: a lush green path leading to the gates
          of the Knights of Malta’s headquarters, followed by a glimpse of the
          basilica’s iconic dome framed by a tunnel of greenery. The view has
          earned the keyhole its reputation as one of the most beautiful and
          unexpected sights in Rome.
        </p>
        <h3>Why It’s Special</h3>
        <p>
          What makes the Knights of Malta Keyhole so special is the way it
          embodies the layered history of Rome. From ancient times to the
          present, the city has been built with intentionality, with many hidden
          gems like this one that reveal themselves to the discerning eye. The
          perspective of St. Peter’s Basilica, visible through a simple keyhole,
          speaks to the city’s historical, religious, and architectural
          significance.
