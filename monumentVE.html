        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Commissioned in 1885 and inaugurated in 1911, the monument was
          designed by architect Giuseppe Sacconi to commemorate the unification
          of Italy. The construction took several decades and was completed in
          1935. Built entirely of white Botticino marble, the Vittoriano was
          meant to symbolize Italy’s newfound unity and strength. Throughout the
          years, the monument has played a central role in national
          celebrations, hosting official ceremonies and military parades. It
          also serves as the location of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,
          established in 1921 to honor the fallen soldiers of World War I.

          <li>
            A fascinating fact: the horse’s stomach is large enough to fit a
            small table and was reportedly used for a celebratory meal during
            construction!

        <h3>Legends & Curiosities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>The "Typewriter" and "Wedding Cake" Nicknames: </em>Due to its
            massive white marble structure, locals humorously compare the
            monument to a typewriter or a tiered wedding cake.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Mussolini’s Speeches: </em>During Fascist rule, dictator Benito
            Mussolini often delivered speeches from the Vittoriano’s balcony.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Controversial Construction: </em>Many historic buildings,
            including medieval churches, were demolished to make way for the
            monument, leading to criticism over its impact on Rome’s ancient
            cityscape.
