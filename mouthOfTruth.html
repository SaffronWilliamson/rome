        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Mouth of Truth is a large, circular marble relief measuring about
          1.75 meters (5 feet 9 inches) in diameter. Dating back to the 1st
          century AD, it is believed to have originally been a manhole cover or
          part of an ancient Roman fountain. The face carved into the stone is
          thought to represent a river god, such as Oceanus or Tiberinus, the
          deity of the Tiber River. The stone gained legendary status in the
          Middle Ages when it became associated with the belief that it could
          reveal dishonesty. According to tradition, anyone who placed their
          hand inside the mouth and told a lie would have their hand bitten off.
          This superstition has made the Bocca della Verità one of Rome’s most
          iconic and photographed attractions.

        <h3>The Legend of the Mouth of Truth</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most famous stories associated with the Bocca della Verità
          involves a woman accused of adultery. To prove her innocence, she
          devised a clever trick. Before placing her hand in the mouth, she had
          her lover-disguised as a stranger-kiss her in front of the crowd. She
          then swore she had only ever been touched by her husband and "this
          man" (referring to her lover). The Mouth of Truth did not punish her,
          as she technically told the truth, showcasing the ingenuity of ancient
          Romans.

            Holiday, starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. In a playful
            scene, Peck's character pretends his hand has been bitten off,
            causing Hepburn’s character to scream in shock.
