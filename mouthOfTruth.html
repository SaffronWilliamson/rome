        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Mouth of Truth (Bocca della Verità) is one of Rome’s most famous
          and mysterious landmarks. This massive marble mask, depicting a
          bearded face, dates back to the 1st century AD and is believed to have
          been part of an ancient Roman fountain or a drain cover. Its true
          purpose remains unknown, but over time, it became associated with a
          medieval legend that claims it can detect liars. The superstition
          states that if someone puts their hand inside the mouth and tells a
          lie, their hand will be bitten off! Today, the Bocca della Verità is
          located inside the portico of the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin,
          where thousands of visitors test their honesty each year.
