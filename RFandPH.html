        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Roman Forum and Palatine Hill together form the heart of Ancient
          Rome, representing both its political, religious, and commercial
          center (Forum) and its most prestigious residential area (Palatine
          Hill). According to legend, Romulus founded Rome on Palatine Hill in
          753 BC, after being raised by the she-wolf Lupa. As the city grew, the
          Forum became the main hub of Roman life, where senators debated,
          elections were held, and triumphal processions took place. Palatine
          Hill, overlooking the Forum, became the most exclusive neighborhood,
          home to emperors and aristocrats. After the fall of the Western Roman
          Empire, both sites fell into ruin and were eventually buried under
          centuries of debris. Excavations in the 19th and 20th centuries
          uncovered the remains, allowing visitors today to walk through the
          heart of ancient Rome’s glory.
