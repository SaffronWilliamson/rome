        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Pienza, often referred to as the “ideal city of the Renaissance,” is a
          UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Val d'Orcia region of
          Tuscany. Originally known as Corsignano, the town was transformed in
          the 15th century by Pope Pius II (Enea Silvio Piccolomini), who was
          born there. As pope, he sought to turn his birthplace into a model
          Renaissance town, and thus, Corsignano was rebuilt and renamed Pienza
          in his honor. Pienza is a prime example of Renaissance urban planning,
          designed to reflect the ideals of harmony, beauty, and functionality.
          The town’s redesign was carried out by some of the era’s most
          prominent architects, including Bernardo Rossellino, who worked under
          the guidance of Pope Pius II. Over time, Pienza became a significant
          cultural and political center in Tuscany, though its influence waned
          after the papacy of Pius II. Despite this, it retains its Renaissance
          charm, attracting visitors with its historical significance and
          stunning views of the surrounding landscape.
