        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Pantheon is one of the best-preserved monuments of Ancient Rome,
          originally built in 27 BC by Marcus Agrippa, the son-in-law of Emperor
          Augustus. However, the current structure dates back to 118–125 AD,
          when Emperor Hadrian rebuilt it following fires and destruction.
          Unlike many ancient Roman buildings, the Pantheon has been in
          continuous use for over 2,000 years. It was first a pagan temple
          dedicated to all gods, and in 609 AD, it was converted into a
          Christian church, contributing to its remarkable preservation. The
          Latin inscription on its façade reads: M·AGRIPPA·L·F·COS·TERTIVM·FECIT
          which translates to: "Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, made this
          building when consul for the third time." Although this refers to
          Agrippa’s original construction, the current structure was built under
          Hadrian.

        <h3>Architectural Marvels</h3>
        <p>The Dome</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Pantheon’s dome is the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the
            world, with a diameter of 43.3 meters (142 feet).
          </li>
          <li>
            At the center of the dome is the oculus, a 9-meter (30-foot) wide
            opening that allows natural light to flood the interior.
          </li>
          <li>
            The structure was designed with a series of coffers (recessed
            panels), reducing its weight while enhancing its visual beauty.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Interior and the Altar</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Pantheon’s vast, open space was designed to evoke a sense of the
            divine, with its massive columns and symmetrical layout.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since the 7th century, the Pantheon has functioned as a Christian
            church, known as the Basilica of St. Mary and the Martyrs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The main altar is used for religious services, and the space is
            adorned with Renaissance tombs, including those of the famous artist
            Raphael and Italian kings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Portico and Columns</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The entrance features 16 massive Corinthian columns, each made of
            Egyptian granite and standing 11.8 meters (39 feet) tall.
          </li>
          <li>
            The portico leads visitors into the vast rotunda, creating an
            awe-inspiring transition from the outside world into the grand
            interior.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fun Facts & Legends</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Rain Inside the Pantheon? </em>Despite being open to the sky,
            the oculus allows only minimal water to enter due to the building’s
            unique engineering. The slightly sloped floor helps drain any
            rainwater efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>A Perfect Sphere: </em>The height of the Pantheon (from the
            floor to the oculus) is exactly equal to its diameter, making it a
            perfect sphere in design.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Michelangelo’s Admiration: </em>The legendary artist
            Michelangelo was so impressed by the Pantheon’s architecture that he
            declared it “the work of angels, not men.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>A Pagan Temple Turned Christian Church – </em>The Pantheon was
            originally dedicated to all Roman gods, but its conversion into a
            Christian church in 609 AD saved it from destruction.
          </li>
        </ul>
