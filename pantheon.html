        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Pantheon was originally built in 27 BC by Marcus Agrippa, the
          son-in-law of Emperor Augustus. However, the current structure dates
          back to 118–125 AD, when it was rebuilt by Emperor Hadrian following
          fires and destruction. Unlike many ancient Roman structures, the
          Pantheon has been continuously in use throughout history, first as a
          pagan temple and later as a Christian church, which contributed to its
          remarkable preservation. The inscription on the front reads:
          M·AGRIPPA·L·F·COS·TERTIVM·FECIT, meaning “Marcus Agrippa, son of
          Lucius, made this building when consul for the third time.” This
          inscription refers to Agrippa’s original construction, though the
          current building was later reconstructed by Hadrian.

        <h3>Architectural Marvel</h3>
        <p>The Dome</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Pantheon’s dome is the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the
            world, with a diameter of 43.3 meters (142 feet).
          </li>
          <li>
            At the center of the dome is the oculus, a 9-meter (30-foot) wide
            opening that allows natural light to flood the interior.
          </li>
          <li>
            The structure was designed with a series of coffers (recessed
            panels), reducing its weight while enhancing its visual beauty.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Interior and the Altar</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Pantheon’s vast, open space was designed to evoke a sense of the
            divine, with its massive columns and symmetrical layout.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since the 7th century, the Pantheon has functioned as a Christian
            church, known as the Basilica of St. Mary and the Martyrs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The main altar is used for religious services, and the space is
            adorned with Renaissance tombs, including those of the famous artist
            Raphael and Italian kings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Portico and Columns</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The entrance features 16 massive Corinthian columns, each made of
            Egyptian granite and standing 11.8 meters (39 feet) tall.
          </li>
          <li>
            The portico leads visitors into the vast rotunda, creating an
            awe-inspiring transition from the outside world into the grand
            interior.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fun Facts & Legends</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Rain Inside the Pantheon? </em>Despite being open to the sky,
            the oculus allows only minimal water to enter due to the building’s
            unique engineering. The slightly sloped floor helps drain any
            rainwater efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>A Perfect Sphere: </em>The height of the Pantheon (from the
            floor to the oculus) is exactly equal to its diameter, making it a
            perfect sphere in design.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Michelangelo’s Admiration: </em>The legendary artist
            Michelangelo was so impressed by the Pantheon’s architecture that he
            declared it “the work of angels, not men.”
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Visiting Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Best Time to Visit: </em>Early morning or late afternoon to
            avoid crowds and enjoy the mystical lighting through the oculus.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Best Time to Visit: </em>The Piazza della Rotonda, Piazza
            Navona, and the Trevi Fountain are all within walking distance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Nearby Attractions: </em>Try a classic Roman meal at one of the
