        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Villa Borghese is Rome’s most famous and expansive park, often called
          the “green heart” of the city. Originally a private vineyard, it was
          transformed in 1605 by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the nephew of Pope
          Paul V, into a grand estate with landscaped gardens and a magnificent
          villa to house his impressive art collection. In 1903, the Italian
          government acquired Villa Borghese, opening it as a public park,
          making it one of the most beloved green spaces in Rome. Today, it is
          home to museums, fountains, lakes, and scenic walkways, offering a
          perfect blend of nature, art, and history.
