        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Villa Borghese traces its origins back to the early 17th century, when
          Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew of Pope Paul V, commissioned the
          creation of a lavish estate. Originally designed as a private villa
          with extensive gardens, it was transformed into a public park in 1903
          when the Italian government acquired the property. The estate was
          designed as a grand retreat for the Borghese family, one of Rome’s
          most influential noble houses. Over the years, it became a center for
          art and leisure, with sculptures, fountains, and temples enhancing its
          beauty.
