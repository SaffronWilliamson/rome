        <p>
          The Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Biagio is located just outside the
          medieval town of Montepulciano, in the heart of Tuscany. The sanctuary
          was constructed between 1518 and 1545, under the guidance of architect
          Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, who was commissioned to design a
          structure that would honor the Virgin Mary. The church is dedicated to
          the Madonna di San Biagio, the patron saint of Montepulciano. The
          sanctuary was built in the Renaissance style and was intended to be a
          pilgrimage site for the faithful. The location is significant, as it
          is situated on a hill that offers stunning views of the surrounding
          Tuscan countryside, adding to the spiritual ambiance of the site. Over
          the centuries, the sanctuary has been an important place of worship
          and devotion, hosting numerous religious services and festivals. The
          church's serene setting and architectural beauty make it a popular
