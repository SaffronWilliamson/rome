        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          St. Peter’s Basilica, located in Vatican City, is one of the largest
          and most important churches in the world. Its construction began in
          1506 under Pope Julius II and was completed in 1626, taking over 120
          years to finish. It stands over the site where St. Peter, one of Jesus
          Christ's apostles and the first pope, is believed to have been buried.
          The basilica has been a symbol of the Catholic Church’s power,
          grandeur, and spirituality. The original St. Peter’s Basilica was
          built in the 4th century by the Roman Emperor Constantine. However, it
          fell into disrepair over the centuries, leading to the decision by
          Pope Julius II to demolish the old church and build a new, grander
          one. The church's construction involved some of the greatest minds of
          the Renaissance and Baroque periods, including Michelangelo, Donato
          Bramante, Raphael, and Carlo Maderno. St. Peter’s Basilica became the
          center of Catholicism, hosting papal ceremonies, major Christian
          holidays, and serving as the burial place for many popes. Today, it
          remains a major pilgrimage site and one of the most visited religious
          sites in the world

          <li>
            The iconic dome of St. Peter’s Basilica, designed by Michelangelo,
            is a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture. The dome rises 136
            meters (448 feet) above the basilica and is considered one of the
            largest and most impressive domes in the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            The interior of the dome features stunning mosaics, and visitors can
            climb to the top for an incredible panoramic view of Vatican City
            and Rome.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The façade of St. Peter’s Basilica, designed by Carlo Maderno, is an
            example of Baroque architecture. The grand entrance features statues
            of Christ, St. Peter, and other saints, with the words “Apostolic
            See” inscribed above the door.
          </li>
          <li>
            The colonnade outside the basilica, designed by Gian Lorenzo
            Bernini, forms a grand, sweeping embrace around St. Peter's Square
            and is a symbol of the Church’s welcoming arms.

            itself, with a grand colonnade of 284 columns and 88 pilasters
            designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The columns create a sense of
            unity and embrace for the faithful.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the center of the square stands an ancient Egyptian obelisk,

        <p>The Baldachin (Altar Canopy)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Above the main altar of St. Peter’s Basilica is the Baldachin, a

            Baroque structure is an artistic and architectural focal point of
            the basilica, drawing the eye toward the high altar, which is built
            directly above the tomb of St. Peter.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Baldachin symbolizes the papal authority and marks the place
            where the pope celebrates the Mass.

          <li>
            One of the most famous sculptures in the world, Michelangelo’s Pietà
            is housed in the basilica. Created when Michelangelo was just 24
            years old, this masterpiece depicts the Virgin Mary holding the body
            of Christ after his crucifixion.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sculpture is renowned for its emotional depth and exquisite
            craftsmanship and is displayed in a protected glass case to preserve
            it.
          </li>

        <ul>

        <h3>Fun Facts & Legends</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>St. Peter’s Tomb: </em>Beneath the basilica lies the tomb of St.
            Peter, the first pope and one of Jesus’ apostles. The location of
            the tomb is one of the main reasons St. Peter’s Basilica was built
            where it stands. Pilgrims have visited the site for centuries to pay
            homage to St. Peter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>The Vatican Grottoes: </em>Below the main floor of the basilica
            is a series of chapels and tombs known as the Vatican Grottoes,
            where many popes have been buried. The area also houses several
            notable tombs, including those of Pope John Paul II and Pope Pius
            XII.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>The Bronze Statue of St. Peter: </em>A well-worn bronze statue
            of St. Peter is located near the basilica's entrance. Pilgrims
            traditionally kiss the foot of the statue for blessings. The statue
            has worn down over time due to the thousands of visitors who have
            touched it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Michelangelo's Influence: </em>Michelangelo was not only
            responsible for designing the dome but also for overseeing some of
            the basilica's early planning, although his work was ultimately
            carried on by other architects after his death.
