        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Piazza Navona is one of Rome’s most famous and picturesque squares,
          known for its Baroque architecture, fountains, and vibrant atmosphere.
          The site originally housed Stadium of Domitian, built in 86 AD to host
          athletic competitions. The stadium could accommodate up to 30,000
          spectators, and its distinctive oval shape remains preserved in
          today’s square. In the 15th century, the stadium ruins were
          transformed into a public square, becoming a center for markets,
          festivals, and public gatherings. By the 17th century, under the
          patronage of Pope Innocent X, Piazza Navona was redesigned into the
          stunning Baroque masterpiece that we see today.

        <h3>Architectural Marvels</h3>
        <p>The Fountains</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fountain of the Four Rivers (Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi) – Designed
            by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1651, this is the centerpiece of the
            piazza. It represents the four great rivers of the world:
            <ul class="secondary-list">
              <li>
                -<em> Nile (Africa) – </em>A veiled figure, symbolizing the
                river’s unknown source.
              </li>
              <li>
                -<em> Danube (Europe) – </em>The most “honored” river, as it
                touches Catholic lands.
              </li>
              <li>
                -<em> Ganges (Asia) – </em>Holding an oar, representing
                navigability.
              </li>
              <li>
                -<em> Rio de la Plata (Americas) – </em>Sitting on coins,
                symbolizing the riches of the New World.
              </li>
              <li>
                - The fountain is topped by a towering Egyptian obelisk, adding
                to its dramatic presence.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Fountain of Neptune (Fontana del Nettuno) – </em>Created in
            1574, but its statues of Neptune battling sea creatures were added
            in the 19th century.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Fountain of the Moor (Fontana del Moro) – </em>Originally
            designed in 1575 by Giacomo della Porta, with later additions by
            Bernini, featuring a Moor wrestling a dolphin.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Church of Sant'Agnese in Agone</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Overlooking the piazza, this stunning Baroque church was designed by
            Francesco Borromini, a rival of Bernini. It was built on the
            legendary spot where Saint Agnes was martyred in 304 AD. The
            church’s convex façade and majestic dome add to the grandeur of
            Piazza Navona.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fontana del Moro & Fontana del Nettuno</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the southern end, the Fontana del Moro features a Moor wrestling
            a sea creature, sculpted by Giacomo della Porta and later enhanced
            by Bernini.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the northern end, the Fontana del Nettuno depicts Neptune
            battling a sea monster, a later addition to the piazza.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Palazzo Pamphilj</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This grand 17th-century palace was once the residence of Pope
            Innocent X’s family. Today, it serves as the Brazilian Embassy, but
            its opulent frescoed interiors by Pietro da Cortona are worth
            admiring.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fun Facts & Legends</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>A Rivalry in Stone? </em>It’s said that Bernini’s Fountain of
            the Four Rivers features a figure shielding its face from
            Borromini’s Church of Sant'Agnese, symbolizing their artistic
            rivalry. However, this is likely just a myth, as the fountain was
            completed before the church’s façade.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Flooded Piazza – </em>Until the 19th century, Piazza Navona was
            occasionally flooded in the summer for naval games and cooling off
            in the heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Christmas Market – </em>Every December, the piazza transforms
            into a festive Christmas market, filled with stalls selling treats,
            decorations, and toys.
          </li>
        </ul>
