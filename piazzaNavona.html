        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Piazza Navona stands on the site of the ancient Stadium of Domitian,
          built in the 1st century AD for athletic competitions. The stadium
          could hold up to 30,000 spectators and was used for running events and
          other sports. Over time, the area was repurposed into a public square,
          maintaining the elongated shape of the original stadium. During the
          17th century, under the patronage of Pope Innocent X, the square
          underwent a grand transformation into a Baroque masterpiece. Many of
          the stunning architectural and artistic features seen today date back
          to this period.

        <h3>Main Attractions</h3>
        <p>Fountain of the Four Rivers (Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1651, this magnificent fountain
            is the centerpiece of the piazza.
          </li>
          <li>
            It represents four major rivers from different continents: the Nile
            (Africa), Danube (Europe), Ganges (Asia), and Río de la Plata
            (Americas).
          </li>
          <li>
            The fountain is topped with an ancient Egyptian obelisk, adding to
            its grandeur.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Church of Sant'Agnese in Agone</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A stunning Baroque church designed by Francesco Borromini, located
            right in front of Bernini’s fountain.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is dedicated to Saint Agnes, who, according to legend, was
            martyred on this very site.
          </li>
          <li>
            The church’s striking facade and elegant dome make it a prominent
            feature of the square.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fontana del Moro & Fontana del Nettuno</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the southern end, the Fontana del Moro features a Moor wrestling
            a sea creature, sculpted by Giacomo della Porta and later enhanced
            by Bernini.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the northern end, the Fontana del Nettuno depicts Neptune
            battling a sea monster, a later addition to the piazza.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fun Facts & Legends</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A famous urban legend suggests that Bernini designed the figures on
            the Fountain of the Four Rivers in a way that they appear to be
            reacting negatively to Borromini’s nearby church. However, this is
            purely a myth, as the fountain was completed before the church.
          </li>
          <li>
            In past centuries, the piazza was sometimes intentionally flooded
            during summer to provide a cooling effect for the city’s elite.
          </li>
          <li>
            Today, Piazza Navona is a hub for street artists, performers, and
            bustling cafés, making it a perfect spot for people-watching and
            soaking in the Roman atmosphere.
          </li>
        </ul>
