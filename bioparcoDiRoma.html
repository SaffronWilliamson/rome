        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Founded in 1911, Bioparco di Roma was originally designed as a
          traditional zoological garden, meant to showcase exotic animals for
          public enjoyment. Over the decades, it evolved into a modern
          conservation-focused park, dedicated to protecting endangered species
          and promoting ecological awareness. Today, Bioparco prioritizes animal
          welfare and environmental education while offering visitors an
          engaging and immersive experience.
