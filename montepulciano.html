        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Montepulciano is a medieval hilltop town in Tuscany, famous for its
          wine, Renaissance architecture, and breathtaking views. Founded by the
          Etruscans in the 4th century BC, it later flourished under the Medici
          family during the Renaissance. Throughout history, Montepulciano was a
          strategic stronghold, contested between Florence and Siena due to its
          prime location. Today, it is known for its charming streets, historic
          palaces, and world-renowned Vino Nobile di Montepulciano wine.
