        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The construction of Castel Sant’Angelo began in 123 AD under the
          orders of Emperor Hadrian, who intended it as a mausoleum for himself
          and his family. By the 5th century, the building was converted into a
          military fortress to defend Rome from barbarian invasions. During the
          Middle Ages, Castel Sant’Angelo was repurposed by the popes, who
          reinforced its walls and used it as a refuge during times of crisis. A
          secret passage known as the Passetto di Borgo was built to connect the
          castle to the Vatican, allowing popes to escape in times of danger.
          The fortress also served as a prison for many notable figures,
          including the famous sculptor Benvenuto Cellini.

            deadly plague in Rome.
