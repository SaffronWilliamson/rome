        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Castel Sant’Angelo, also known as the Mausoleum of Hadrian, is one of
          Rome’s most fascinating and historically rich landmarks. It was
          originally built in 135–139 AD as a mausoleum for Emperor Hadrian and
          his family. Over the centuries, it was transformed into a fortress,
          papal residence, prison, and museum. During the Middle Ages, the
          castle became a military stronghold due to its strategic location near
          the Vatican. In the 6th century, it was renamed Castel Sant’Angelo
          after a legend in which Archangel Michael appeared atop the structure,
          sheathing his sword as a sign of the end of a deadly plague in Rome.
          The castle is also connected to St. Peter’s Basilica via a secret
          corridor called Passetto di Borgo, which popes used as an escape route
          during sieges.

            legend, appeared above the fortress in 590 AD to signal the end of a
            deadly plague in Rome.
