        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Spanish Steps (Scalinata di Trinità dei Monti) are one of Rome’s
          most famous landmarks, known for their elegant design and lively
          atmosphere. The staircase of 135 steps was built between 1723 and
          1725, designed by Francesco de Sanctis and financed by Étienne
          Gueffier, a French diplomat. The steps were constructed to connect
          Piazza di Spagna (below) with the Trinità dei Monti Church (above).
          Despite their name, the Spanish Steps were funded by the French and
          are located near the Spanish Embassy to the Holy See, which influenced
          their name. Over the centuries, the Spanish Steps became a meeting
          place for artists, poets, and travelers, and today, they remain one of
          the most visited and photographed sites in Rome.

            church was completed in the late 16th century.

            At the foot of the steps in Piazza di Spagna sits the Fountain of

            Lorenzo Bernini) in the early 1600s.

            The fountain is shaped like a half-sunken boat, inspired by a legend

            a flood.
