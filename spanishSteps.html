        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Spanish Steps were built between 1723 and 1725, designed by
          Francesco de Sanctis and financed by the French diplomat Étienne
          Gueffier. The staircase was constructed to connect the Trinità dei
          Monti church, which was under French patronage, with Piazza di Spagna,
          a lively Roman square named after the Spanish Embassy that was located
          there. Over the centuries, the Spanish Steps have become a favorite
          spot for artists, poets, and travelers, symbolizing Rome’s romantic
          and cosmopolitan spirit.

        <h3>Architectural Highlights</h3>
        <p>The Staircase</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Spanish Steps consist of 135 steps, arranged in a wide,
            irregular pattern that creates a stunning visual effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            The design allows for multiple terraces, making it a perfect place
            to sit, relax, and admire the view of the city.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Trinità dei Monti Church</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Located at the top of the steps, this beautiful Renaissance-style
            church was completed in the late 16th century.
          </li>
          <li>
            It offers breathtaking views over Rome and is home to important
            works of art, including frescoes by Daniele da Volterra, a pupil of
            Michelangelo.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fontana della Barcaccia</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the foot of the steps in Piazza di Spagna sits the Fountain of
            the Ugly Boat, designed by Pietro Bernini (father of the famous Gian
            Lorenzo Bernini) in the early 1600s.
          </li>
          <li>
            The fountain is shaped like a half-sunken boat, inspired by a legend
            that a small boat was carried to this spot by the Tiber River during
            a flood.
          </li>
        </ul>
